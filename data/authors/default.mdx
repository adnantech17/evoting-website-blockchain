Elections have a significant impact on a nation's development, either directly or indirectly. In this modern digitally-driven era, electronic voting systems have become increasingly popular in many nations. If some key aspects like privacy, transparency, security, and tamper resistance are carefully integrated, this shift towards E-voting has the potential to become widely accepted. E-voting, if implemented effectively, has the capacity to mitigate the substantial financial and time components involved with executing national-level elections. One potential way to implement the system effectively is to incorporate blockchain technology, which is known for being distributed and decentralized. Blockchain provides a strong platform for a sophisticated electronic voting system by inherently addressing concerns with transparency and tamper resistance. In this work, we designed and implemented an Ethereum blockchain-based E-voting system that is technically solid in terms of security, privacy, and trust.
